## Updating Objects in State

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn’t change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.

## What’s a mutation?

You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.

const [x, setX] = useState(0);

So far you’ve been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are “immutable”, meaning unchangeable or “read-only”. You can trigger a re-render to replace a value:

setX(5);

The x state changed from 0 to 5, but the number 0 itself did not change. It’s not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.

Now consider an object in state:

`const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });`

Technically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a mutation:

position.x = 5;

_However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them as if they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them._
