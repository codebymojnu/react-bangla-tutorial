Alright, let's look carefully:

Your sentence:

> Then clone first your old repository. second copy your new project to old project repository. then push it.

### Problems:

1. **"Then clone first your old repository"**  
   ðŸ”¹ Word order is wrong. "First" should come before "clone" or be connected properly.  
   Correct: **"First, clone your old repository."**

2. **"second copy your new project to old project repository"**  
   ðŸ”¹ Missing comma after "Second", and **"to old project repository"** sounds a bit incomplete. It should be **"to the old project repository."**  
   Correct: **"Second, copy your new project into the old project repository."**

3. **"then push it"**  
   ðŸ”¹ Again, needs a capital letter at the start because it's a new sentence: "Then push it."

### Fully Corrected Version:

> **First, clone your old repository. Second, copy your new project into the old project repository. Then push it.**

---

### Why the changes:

- **Capitalization:** Always start a sentence with a capital letter (First, Second, Then).
- **Word Order:** "First clone" sounds odd â€” better to say "First, clone..."
- **Articles:** "the" is needed before "old project repository" because it's a specific one.
- **Commas:** "First," "Second," should be followed by commas when listing steps.
