Problem:

`
AddTaskForm.jsx:19

           GET http://localhost:5173/src/context/TasksContext.js?t=1745816837088 net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
           `

Alright, let's look at this carefully.

Your error says:

`GET http://localhost:5173/src/context/TasksContext.js?t=1745816837088 net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)`

That **404 (Not Found)** error means **the file itâ€™s trying to load does not exist at that path**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Possible reasons:**

1. In your `AddTaskForm.jsx`, you probably wrote something like:

   ```jsx
   import { something } from "/src/context/TasksContext";
   ```

or

```jsx
import { something } from "src/context/TasksContext";
```

but **maybe the actual file is missing** or **the import path is wrong**.

2. **Maybe your file name is wrong** â€” for example:

   - Your actual file is called `TasksContext.jsx`, not `.js`
   - Or maybe it's in a different folder.

3. **Maybe you moved/deleted the file** but forgot to fix the import.

### How to fix:

- Make sure `TasksContext.js` file exists in `src/context/`.
- If your file is `.jsx`, change the import:
  ```jsx
  import { something } from "../context/TasksContext.jsx";
  ```
- Or, correct the path if your folder structure is different.

Would you like to show me your `AddTaskForm.jsx` import lines?
I can tell you exactly which line is wrong if you want. ðŸŒŸ
