Of course!  
Hereâ€™s a very simple **`switch case`** example in JavaScript:

```javascript
let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    dayName = "Saturday";
    break;
  case 7:
    dayName = "Sunday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Invalid day";
}

console.log(dayName); // Output: Wednesday
```

---

**Simple explanation:**

- `switch(day)` checks the value of `day`.
- It matches with `case 3:` â†’ so it sets `dayName = "Wednesday"`.
- `break` means stop checking other cases after a match.
- If no match is found, it goes to `default:`.

Would you like me to show an even shorter real-world example too? ðŸš€
