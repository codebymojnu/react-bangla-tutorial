Got it! If you want to create an array where the length matches the number you provide, here's how you can do it in JavaScript:

```javascript
function createArrayWithLength(length) {
  return new Array(length).fill(0); // Creates an array of the given length, filled with 0
}

// Example usage:
let length = 3;
let array = createArrayWithLength(length);
console.log(array); // Output: [0, 0, 0]
```

In this example, if you give the number `3`, the array will be created with a length of 3, and it will be filled with `0`s. You can change `0` to any other default value you'd like to fill the array with.
