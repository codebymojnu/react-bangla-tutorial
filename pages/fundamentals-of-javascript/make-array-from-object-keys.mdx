To make an **array from an object's keys** in JavaScript, you can use the built-in `Object.keys()` method.

### ðŸ”¹ Syntax:

```js
const keysArray = Object.keys(yourObject);
```

### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```js
const task = {
  title: "Write Blog",
  status: "To Do",
  priority: "High",
};

const keys = Object.keys(task);
console.log(keys); // Output: ["title", "status", "priority"]
```

This gives you an array of all the keys (property names) from the object.

Would you also like to get the values or both keys and values together?
