Hereâ€™s a sample **tasks data structure** following the same pattern from your `TaskList` component. This data is organized by task status: "To-Do", "On Progress", etc., and includes title, description, and date:

```js
const tasksData = {
  todo: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Content Writer",
      description: "Prepare proctor for client meeting",
      date: "February 20, 2024",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Develop API",
      description: "Prepare proctor for client meeting",
      date: "February 20, 2024",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      title: "Deploy to VPS",
      description: "Prepare proctor for client meeting",
      date: "February 20, 2024",
    },
  ],
  inProgress: [
    {
      id: 4,
      title: "Content Writer",
      description: "Prepare proctor for client meeting",
      date: "February 20, 2024",
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      title: "Design UI",
      description: "Create wireframe for dashboard layout",
      date: "February 21, 2024",
    },
  ],
  completed: [
    {
      id: 6,
      title: "Set Up Project",
      description: "Initialize with Vite + Tailwind CSS",
      date: "February 18, 2024",
    },
  ],
  backlog: [
    {
      id: 7,
      title: "SEO Optimization",
      description: "Research keyword and apply meta tags",
      date: "February 25, 2024",
    },
  ],
};
```

You can map this data in your component to dynamically render tasks per column. Would you like me to show how to use this `tasksData` in your component to avoid hardcoding each task?
