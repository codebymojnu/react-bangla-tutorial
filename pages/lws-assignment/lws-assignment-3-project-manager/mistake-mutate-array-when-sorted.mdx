The issue you're facing—where the sorting only works on the **first click** but not on **subsequent clicks**—is because of this line:

```js
const sorted = tasks[category].sort((a, b) => {
  return new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date);
});
```

### ❗ Problem

You're **mutating the original `tasks[category]` array** directly by using `.sort()` (which **sorts in place**). So after the first click, the array is already sorted, and clicking again doesn't create a new change—React doesn't re-render unless state changes.

### ✅ Solution

Make a **copy** of the array before sorting to prevent in-place mutation:

```js
function handleSorting() {
  const sorted = [...tasks[category]].sort((a, b) => {
    return new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date);
  });
  setSortedTasks(sorted);
}
```

Or using `structuredClone` if deep copy is needed (not here, though):

```js
const sorted = structuredClone(tasks[category]).sort(...);
```

This way, `sortedTasks` will be a fresh array every time, and the component will re-render correctly.

Would you like a version where clicking toggles between ascending and descending sort?

Thanks for the update. The issue is **still not solved** because you're **not making a deep copy of the task array**.

### ❌ Problem:

This line:

```js
const clonseTasks = { ...tasks };
```

**does not clone the inner array** (`tasks[category]`), so `.sort()` is **still mutating the original array** in `tasks`.

### ✅ Real Solution:

You must **clone the array itself**, like this:

```js
function handleSorting() {
  const sorted = [...tasks[category]].sort((a, b) => {
    return new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date);
  });
  setSortedTasks(sorted);
}
```

You **don't need to clone the full `tasks` object**. You just need to clone the specific array before sorting.

### ✅ Also Fix the `setSortingToggle` Order

React state updates are async. You should handle sorting _after_ the new state value is decided. So:

```js
onClick={() => {
  const nextToggle = !sortingToogle;
  setSortingToogle(nextToggle);

  if (nextToggle) {
    handleSorting(); // Sort only when toggle is turned ON
  }
}}
```

---

### 🛠 Final Fix (Use This Version):

```js
function handleSorting() {
  const sorted = [...tasks[category]].sort((a, b) => {
    return new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date);
  });
  setSortedTasks(sorted);
}

onClick={() => {
  const nextToggle = !sortingToogle;
  setSortingToogle(nextToggle);
  if (nextToggle) {
    handleSorting();
  }
}};
```

Let me know if you'd like to implement a toggle between **ascending and descending** as well.
