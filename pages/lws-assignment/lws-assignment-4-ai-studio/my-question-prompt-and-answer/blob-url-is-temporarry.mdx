You're encountering a **common issue** when storing image URLs like this:

```js
{
  src: "blob:http://localhost:5173/948366be-7f9d-4675-9936-4e9e784a5e28";
}
```

These are **`blob:` URLs**, and **they are temporary**. They are only valid during the same browser session. Once you reload or come back later, they are gone — which is why your images no longer appear.

---

### ✅ **Why this happens:**

- A `blob:` URL is generated by the browser **at runtime** to represent a `File` or `Blob` object.
- It’s not a permanent URL — it **doesn't survive page reloads**.
- When saved in `localStorage`, it's **useless later**, because the blob it points to no longer exists.

---

### ✅ **Solutions:**

#### ✅ Option 1: Save Base64 String Instead

Convert the image to a Base64 string and store it in `localStorage`.

```js
function fileToBase64(file) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result); // this will be a base64 string
    reader.onerror = reject;
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  });
}
```

Then you can store:

```js
{ src: "data:image/png;base64,...", seed: 2306127 }
```

Later, you can use the Base64 string directly in the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag.

#### ✅ Option 2: Use IndexedDB (more advanced)

If you're dealing with large images or many files, `localStorage` may not be ideal. Instead, use **IndexedDB**, which can store `File`/`Blob` objects persistently.

> But this option is a bit complex and not needed unless you're building a full offline image app.

---

### ✅ Final Suggestion for You:

Since you’re using `blob:` URLs and saving to `localStorage`, switch to this flow:

1. Convert the uploaded image to Base64 using `FileReader`.
2. Save the Base64 string in localStorage instead of the blob URL.
3. Use the Base64 string as `src` in your `<img>` when displaying later.
