Excellent question! You're asking about this part:

```js
setApiParameters((prev) => ({ ...prev, models: data }));
```

👉 Why do we need to put `({ ...prev, models: data })` inside parentheses?

---

### The short answer:

Because we are returning an **object literal** from an _arrow function_.

👉 In JavaScript, an arrow function without curly braces `{}` will implicitly return the expression you write.
👉 BUT if you use `{ ... }` directly after `=>`, JavaScript thinks this is a **function body**, not an object.

Example:

```js
(x) => {
  foo: "bar";
}; // This is treated as a function body! Returns undefined.
```

👉 To tell JavaScript that this is an _object literal_, not a block of code, you wrap it in parentheses:

```js
(x) => ({ foo: "bar" }); // Now it's clear: return an object!
```

---

### In your case:

```js
(prev) => ({ ...prev, models: data });
```

➡️ You want to return an **updated object**:
`{ ...prev, models: data }`

➡️ But if you write:

```js
prev => { ...prev, models: data }
```

This is invalid — JavaScript thinks this is a function body with no return value.

➡️ So you must wrap the object with `()`:

```js
(prev) => ({ ...prev, models: data });
```

---

### Simple rule:

👉 If you use an arrow function and want to immediately return an object → **wrap the object in parentheses**.

---

### Tiny example to test:

```js
const fn1 = () => {
  foo: "bar";
};
console.log(fn1()); // undefined

const fn2 = () => ({ foo: "bar" });
console.log(fn2()); // { foo: 'bar' }
```

If you want, I can also show you **why React state updates often use this pattern** and why it is safer in hooks — just tell me. Would you like to? 🚀✨
