You can set up a **read-only input** easily in HTML (or JSX in React) using the `readonly` attribute.

### In plain HTML:

```html
<input type="text" value="This is read-only" readonly />
```

### In React JSX:

```jsx
<input type="text" value="This is read-only" readOnly />
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Notes:**

- The `readonly` (or `readOnly` in JSX) attribute **prevents the user from editing the input value**.
- The user can still **focus** and **select** the text.
- It is different from `disabled`:

  - `readonly`: value is visible and selectable.
  - `disabled`: value is grayed out and not focusable.

If you tell me **which framework you're using** (HTML, React, Vue, etc.), I can give a more specific example. Would you like that? ðŸš€
