To create and switch branches in Git using the command line, follow these steps:

### **1. Check the Current Branch**

Before creating a new branch, check which branch you're currently on:

```sh
git branch
```

### **2. Create a New Branch**

Use the following command to create a new branch:

```sh
git branch branch_name
```

For example, to create a branch named `feature`:

```sh
git branch feature
```

### **3. Switch to the New Branch**

To switch (checkout) to the newly created branch:

```sh
git checkout feature
```

Or you can create and switch to the new branch in a single command:

```sh
git checkout -b feature
```

### **4. Verify the Active Branch**

Check the active branch again:

```sh
git branch
```

The active branch will be highlighted with `*`.

### **5. Switch Between Branches**

To switch between branches:

```sh
git checkout branch_name
```

For example, switching back to `main`:

```sh
git checkout main
```

### **6. List All Branches**

To list all branches:

```sh
git branch
```

### **7. Push the New Branch to Remote (GitHub)**

If you want to push the new branch to GitHub:

```sh
git push -u origin feature
```

Now, you can work on your new branch and commit changes separately. ðŸš€
