👉 **"Portal"** means a **gateway** or **entry point** to something.

When you hear **"Movie Portal"**, it usually means:  
➡️ **A website or app where you can browse, watch, download, or get information about movies**.

In short:  
✅ A place where many movies are collected together.  
✅ You can search, see details (name, actors, ratings), watch trailers, and sometimes even watch the full movie.

**Example:**

- Netflix is a kind of **movie portal** (but it’s also a streaming service).
- IMDb is another **movie portal** (shows movie info, trailers, ratings).

---

🔵 So if someone says **"Movie Portal Website"**, it usually means:

> A website full of movies, where people come to find and watch movies easily.

Would you like me to show you a simple real-world design idea if you want to build a **Movie Portal**? 🎬✨  
(If yes, I can sketch a quick sample layout too!)
