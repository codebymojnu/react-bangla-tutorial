To build this complex quiz application with extensible features, it's crucial to follow a structured and scalable approach. Here's a step-by-step roadmap tailored to your requirements and a software engineering background:

---

### **1. Requirement Analysis and Feature Breakdown**

- **Understand Features**: Break the requirements into smaller, manageable components like authentication, quiz management, quiz-taking process, results display, leaderboard, etc.
- **Categorize Features**:
  - **Frontend**: UI components for login, quiz list, quiz-taking, results, leaderboard, admin dashboard.
  - **Backend**: APIs for user authentication, quiz data, leaderboard generation.
  - **Authentication**: Implement JWT-based token management.
  - **Role Management**: Separate admin and user access.

---

### **2. Plan the Architecture**

- **Frontend**: Use a framework like **React.js**.
  - Route management (React Router) for private/public/admin routes.
  - Component-based structure for reusability.
- **Backend**: Use **Node.js** with **Express** or **NestJS**.
  - API structure for login, registration, quiz handling, and leaderboard.
  - Authentication middleware for JWT.
- **Database**: Use **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for flexibility.
  - Separate collections/tables for Users, Quizzes, Attempts, and Leaderboards.

---

### **3. Set Up Development Environment**

- **Version Control**: Set up a GitHub/GitLab repository for version control.
- **Project Initialization**:
  - Frontend: `npx create-react-app quiz-app` or `Vite` for performance.
  - Backend: `npm init` for the Node.js API.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Frontend: React Router, Axios, JWT decode, a UI library (e.g., Material-UI, Tailwind CSS).
  - Backend: Express, JWT, bcrypt, dotenv, MongoDB/Prisma.
  - Testing: Jest (for unit testing) and Cypress (for end-to-end testing).

---

### **4. Build Incrementally (Feature-by-Feature Development)**

#### **Frontend Development**:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Create login and registration forms.
   - Handle JWT tokens for user sessions.
   - Set up role-based redirects (user/admin).
2. **Home Page**:
   - Fetch and display quizzes from `Quiz List API`.
   - Conditional rendering of the welcome section (logged-in users only).
3. **Quiz Page**:
   - Design question display with "Next" button functionality.
   - Randomize options using `Array.sort()` on each render.
   - Sidebar to track answered and remaining questions.
4. **Results Page**:
   - Calculate marks and display circular progress bar (e.g., react-circular-progressbar).
   - Highlight correct/incorrect answers.
5. **Leaderboard**:
   - Generate and display sorted data (client-side leaderboard logic).

#### **Backend Development**:

1. **APIs for User Management**:
   - Endpoints for login, registration, token refresh.
2. **APIs for Quiz Management**:
   - CRUD operations for quizzes (add, update, delete).
   - Quiz participation status tracking.
3. **APIs for Results and Leaderboard**:
   - Submit quiz attempts.
   - Fetch sorted leaderboard data for a quiz set.

---

### **5. Implement Role-Based Access Control**

- Use middleware in the backend to validate JWT tokens and user roles.
- Protect private routes in React with route guards.

---

### **6. Testing and Iteration**

- **Frontend**: Test each component and route.
- **Backend**: Test APIs using Postman and automated tests.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure smooth interaction between frontend and backend.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Use tools like Cypress for user flows.

---

### **7. Deployment and Future Scalability**

- **Deployment**:
  - Frontend: Deploy on Vercel or Netlify.
  - Backend: Deploy on Heroku or AWS.
- **Future Features**:
  - Modularize the codebase for easier updates.
  - Maintain a roadmap for upcoming features.

---

### **8. Documentation and Maintenance**

- Create clear documentation for:
  - APIs and endpoints.
  - User and admin functionalities.
- Use tools like Swagger for API documentation.

---

By following this roadmap, you can build your application systematically, ensuring it remains extensible and maintainable for future updates. Start small, validate features as you go, and iteratively improve.
