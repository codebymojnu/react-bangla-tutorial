The problem with your code is that you're using `reduce` on `items`, but you're treating both the accumulator `a` and the current item `b` as if they are objects with a `price` property. On the **first iteration**, `a` is actually the **initial value** (`0`), which is a number, and `a.price` will be `undefined`, causing an error.

### ✅ Correct Version:

```js
<div>Total {items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0)}</div>
```

### Explanation:

- `total` starts at `0`.
- `item` is each object in the `items` array (assumed to have a `.price`).
- You add `item.price` to the total in each step.

### Example:

```js
const items = [
  { name: "Pen", price: 10 },
  { name: "Book", price: 50 },
];

// Output: Total 60
```

Let me know if you'd like a version that formats the total as currency (like `৳60` or `$60`).
