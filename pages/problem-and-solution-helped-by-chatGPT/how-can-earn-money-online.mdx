Md. Mojnu Miah, based on your skills and background (React, JavaScript, Tailwind, blogging, YouTube, content writing, etc.), here are **practical ways you can earn some free or little money online**, especially suitable for someone with limited time and looking for quick results:

---

### ✅ 1. **Sell Small Components or Templates**

You know React and Tailwind—so:

- **Create small reusable UI components** (login form, dashboard card, navbar).
- Sell them on **Gumroad**, **Ko-fi**, or **BuyMeACoffee**.
- Even a \$1–\$5 price per item can add up.

➡️ _Extra Tip:_ Share your React-Bangla blog or YouTube channel to gain trust and promote your templates.

---

### ✅ 2. **Microtasks on Freelance Sites**

Do small tasks like:

- Fixing bugs
- Converting Figma to Tailwind code
- Writing HTML email templates

Platforms:

- **Fiverr** (set up a basic gig like: “I will create a responsive login page using React and Tailwind”)
- **Upwork (Entry level)** – Join with a strong profile.
- **Microworkers.com** or **RapidWorkers** for simple copy-paste or sign-up jobs.

---

### ✅ 3. **YouTube Shorts + Affiliate Links**

Make short videos like:

> “Login page with Tailwind in 60 seconds – Download code free!”

Then:

- Include a **Gumroad link** to the source code.
- Add **affiliate links** (like hosting, frontend tools, Udemy courses).

Free traffic, recurring income if promoted well.

---

### ✅ 4. **Blog Monetization (Your React-Bangla Blog)**

- Add **Google AdSense** to your blog.
- Use affiliate banners (like Hostinger, Namecheap, Udemy).
- Write “Top 5 Tailwind templates – free & paid” and include links.

Even with low traffic, you can start making small passive income.

---

### ✅ 5. **Teach One-to-One (Bd Based)**

- Offer online help to university juniors or HSC students learning HTML/CSS/React.
- Charge small (200–500 BDT) per session.

Use Facebook groups (PUST, CSE, Freelancing BD) to offer help.

---

### ✅ 6. **Bangla Programming Facebook Group Posts**

- Share valuable React posts with code and add:

  > “Get full code (only 100৳) – inbox me.”

Some people will buy just to learn.

---

### ✅ 7. **Sell Your Projects on Code Marketplaces**

You can upload your working projects (quiz app, login UI, etc.) on:

- **CodeCanyon**
- **Codester**
- **ThemeForest** (more strict)
