In Bangla, **"ancestor"** means **"পূর্বপুরুষ"** or **"আদিম ব্যক্তি"**.

In the context of React, **"ancestor"** refers to a component higher up in the component tree (a parent or grandparent component) that is responsible for passing data down to its descendant components (child components).

So, here, **"nearest common ancestor"** means the closest component higher in the hierarchy that both components needing data share.
