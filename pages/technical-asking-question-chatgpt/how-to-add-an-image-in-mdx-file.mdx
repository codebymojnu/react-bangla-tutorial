Alright â€” you want to **add an image** inside your `.mdx` file (the one you posted).

In **`.mdx`**, you can add an image in **two simple ways**:

---

### 1. **Using Standard Markdown Syntax**

If the image is in your **public** folder or a URL:

```mdx
![Alt Text](image-path)

Example:
![Full Page Screenshot Example](/images/full-page-screenshot.png)
```

âœ… Here, `/images/full-page-screenshot.png` means:

- If your project has `public/images/full-page-screenshot.png`, it will work.
- Or if it's a URL: `https://example.com/image.png`, you can use that directly.

---

### 2. **Using `<img>` Tag Inside `.mdx`**

Because `.mdx` supports **JSX**, you can also do:

```mdx
<img
  src="/images/full-page-screenshot.png"
  alt="Full Page Screenshot"
  width="600"
/>
```

âœ… Advantages:

- You can control `width`, `height`, `style`, etc.

---

### Example inside your posted `.mdx` content:

Let's say you want to add a screenshot after **"1. If You Want to Screenshot the Whole Page:"**, then:

```mdx
### 1. **If You Want to Screenshot the Whole Page:**

<img
  src="/images/full-page-screenshot.png"
  alt="Full Page Screenshot"
  width="700"
/>

**(a) Browser (like Chrome, Edge, Firefox):**

...
```

### âš¡ Quick Rules to Remember:

| Situation                 | How to Add Image            |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| Local file (in `public/`) | `/images/yourfile.png`      |
| Online URL                | Full link `https://...`     |
| Need width/height control | Use `<img>` JSX             |
| Just simple image         | Use `![Alt](path)` Markdown |
