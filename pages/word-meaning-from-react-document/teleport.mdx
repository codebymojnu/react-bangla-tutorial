In this context, **"teleport"** is used metaphorically. It means transferring or passing data directly to the required components, as if you could instantly move the data to the right place without passing it through intermediate steps.

In Bangla, **"teleport"** would translate to **"টেলিপোর্ট"**, which still keeps the idea of instant or direct transfer. So, when the sentence says "teleport data," it means to send or make the data accessible to components directly, without having to manually pass it down through each level of the component tree.
